    question: "I found a bug. What should I do?",
    answer:
      "As an independent developer, I'm aware that issues may occasionally happen. If you encounter a bug, please report it by creating an issue on Threddit's GitHub repository. This allows me to investigate and address the problem. Additionally, since Threddit relies on Reddit's public JSON API, you might occasionally run into CORS policy issues, which typically result in a 403 error. Unfortunately, this is beyond my control. If this happens, simply wait a few minutes and refresh the page — things should return to normal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies were used to build Threddit?",
    answer:
      "Threddit was built using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and Radix UI. The source code is publicly available on my GitHub repository, and you can find a link to it at the bottom of the page. This is my first project using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind, and as a mostly self-taught developer, I appreciate your understanding and support!",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I create my own version of Threddit?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! The name 'Threddit' isn't unique to this project—you'll find many others with the same name. If you decide to use any part of my code, I kindly ask that you credit me. You can review the app's license on my GitHub repository for more details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will Threddit receive more features in the future?",
    answer:
      "I'd love to add more features, but this is primarily a fun project for me to practice and improve my skills. While I don't plan to dedicate a lot of time or energy to it, I'm open to suggestions! If you'd like to contribute, feel free to clone the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If the changes are functional and align with the project's goals, I'll merge them and credit you for your work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Threddit safe to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Threddit is designed to be safe. The app does not collect any personal information or request sensitive input. I've also implemented input sanitization to prevent potential cyberattacks. While no system is completely immune to attacks, I regularly update dependencies and monitor for security issues. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it on GitHub so I can address it asap. Additionally, please note that Threddit will never ask for permissions like notifications, device access, or personal data. If you encounter anything suspicious, it is NOT from Threddit.",
  },
  {
    question: "I saw a content that shouldn't be here. What can I do?",
    answer:
      "Threddit is a client that displays public content from Reddit. I don't curate or control the content you see — it's all pulled directly from Reddit. If you come across something inappropriate or offensive, please remember that it originates from Reddit users, not Threddit. Neither I nor Threddit endorse or take responsibility for the content displayed. If you have concerns, I recommend reporting the post directly on Reddit.",
  },
  {
    question: "I like your work! Can we get in touch?",

You can find me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/lucascarozza or check out my other projects on GitHub at github.com/lucascarozza. Looking forward to connecting!",
